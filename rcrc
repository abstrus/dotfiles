#
# ~/.rcrc
#

# The rcm dotfile manager can be configured using a .rcrc file in your home 
# directory. This location can be changed by setting the RCRC environment 
# variable. The format is POSIX shell. It is sourced in by the lsrc(1), 
# mkrc(1), rcdn(1), and rcup(1) programs.
#
# It supports these variables:
#   COPY_ALWAYS
#     always copy files that match the listed globs, never symlink them.
#   DOTFILES_DIRS
#     the source directories for dotfiles. The first in the list is the source
#     to which dotfiles created using mkrc(1) are installed. The default value
#     is ~/.dotfiles
#   EXCLUDES
#     a space-separated list of exclude patterns. Exclude patterns are 
#     explained in detail in lsrc(1) under the section EXCLUDE PATTERN.
#   HOSTNAME
#     the hostname for this computer. This is normally computed using the 
#     hostname(1) command, but this command is non-standard and can prove 
#     unreliable. The HOSTNAME variable forces a known hostname.
#   TAGS
#     the default tags.
#   SYMLINK_DIRS
#     a space-separated list of patterns. Directories matching a pattern are 
#     symlinked instead of descended. Patterns are explained in detail in 
#     lsrc(1) under the section EXCLUDE PATTERN.
#   UNDOTTED
#     a space separated list of patterns. Files matching this pattern will be 
#     symlinked without a leading dot. If a file is also in SYMLINK_DIRS, then
#     the directory will be symlinked without a leading dot. Patterns are 
#     explained in detail in lsrc(1) under the section EXCLUDE PATTERN.
